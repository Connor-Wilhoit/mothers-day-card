Custom Little Ardunio Uno Mother's Day "card"

This is a little Arduino project I put together for Mother's Day 2019 - I wanted a card that would last indefinately, and be way cooler than any
store-bought card ever could be.

The code is adapted from an example Arduino file, and because the screen I was using is a generic version of Adafruit's similar screen, a slight
modification to the underlying library code was necessary.  Library code not included, because that's rather unnecessary in my opinion.

The program can be adjusted to suit various time intervals, but as it sits, the entire program will run for ~5 minutes until returning to the
beginning the Arduino's main loop.

The animations are all from the example file, so no credit can be taken there, however they're really cool, so if you need to use any fun animations in
a given project, there may be some useful functions for one to learn from/use.

Feel free to use this code as you want!
